## Technologies used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) single page application - 18.2.0
- State management via [Redux Tool Kit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - 1.8.5
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - 4.8.2
- HTML & CSS

## Testing

The testing strategy for this project is based on the following two libraries:

* [react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library): these are some testing utilities that allow you to write tests that work with actual DOM nodes. You can think of it as a replacement of the popular [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) testing library.
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/): test runner developed by Facebook, it ships with `create-react-app`. It is also used to mock some of the modules that are required on the tests.

## Project Structure

The project mainly consists of two folders
 - public : which contains the index.html file and all the common assets, like images,icons,screenshots
 - src: contains the main business logic codes and the structure is as shown below.

  - mocks : contain the files needed for jest library for mocking css.
  - app: contains the store and hooks
  - common: folder is used for keeping common components, utilities which can be re-used for different features.
   - all reusable components are kept inside the components folder and respective unit test files are present.
  - features: folder consisits of the main feature component. The component consist of the Slice file, the component file, the functional unit test case file and the css file.

The css for feature component consists all the styling for common components as its is a small application. For Bigger application it is recommended to keep the css separate with the components.

Other root files like App.tsx, index.tsx are kept inside the src folder.

### `npm install`

To install all the dependencies.This should be the first step post cloning the repository.

### `npm run build`

  The pop-up contains a check box which will add 5 second delay in adding the question to the main page.

  If either question or answer or both are empty, clicking on Create button will throw an error, preventing empty question/answer from being saved.

- The main view displaying the added Question and Answer List. Each component consist of an edit icon and a delete icon respectively. 

Only the Question is displayec by default , on clicking on the question , answer is displayed. assumption made that more than one question/answer pair can be kept open at a point of time.
